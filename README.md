QuakeLive item timer hack. Video of it in action here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=960pyveNj-s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=960pyveNj-s).

## Does it work?

It did in 2012. I'm sure if you update the offsets in it, it would still work. It was a bit buggy and I had intentions on fixing it, but never got around to it.

## Why?

It was mainly a proof-of-concept made at a friend's request. It was made at a time I stopped playing QuakeLive, and before that I mainly did 5v5 CTF.
